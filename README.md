I collaborated on this project with Yonghee Park, Chief Engineer at <a href="https://www.blackkeystudios.com">Black Key Studios (대한민국)</a>, for the 3D Audio course at NYU w/ Dr Agnieszka Roginska.

dependencies:
- your own individualized HRTFs (head-related transfer functions), if you're lucky enough to have them taken for you
- FFTW
- portaudio
- libsndfile
- inputlib

With loudspeakers and/or studio monitors (crosstalk cancellation), this effect can cause the stereo image to be localized in a small area in front of the listener.

With headphones on (reverse spaciousness), this effect can cause the stereo image to be further internalized inside your head as opposed to a normal headphone listening experience.
