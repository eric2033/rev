I collaborated on this project with Yonghee Park, Chief Engineer at Black Key Studios (대한민국), for the 3D Audio course at NYU w/ Prof Agnieszka Roginska

dependencies:
- your own individualized HRTFs (head-related transfer functions), if you're lucky enough to have them taken for you
- FFTW
- portaudio
- libsndfile

With loudspeakers and/or studio monitors, this effect can cause the stereo image to be localized in a small area in front of the listener.

With headphones on, this effect can cause the stereo image to be further internalized in your head as opposed to a normal headphone listening experience.
